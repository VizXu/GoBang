# Gobang 
This is the game named Gobang,which runs in Linux platform.The game uses the characters interface because we only wanna 
develop an AI engine program. One who is tending to develop GUI with Qt or other tools can use these codes as algorithm.

These codes were writen by c++ with stl. 

These codes run on the Ubuntu or other linux OS,one can download the source code and compile with "make" instruction

Anyone has the authority to download the source code and modify it,but we also do not take the responsibility to any lost 
made by the code.
